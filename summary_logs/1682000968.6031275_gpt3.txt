Write a detailed summary of the following:


sare near lightspeed c, GC origin events in most of our past lightcone would have created a GC that controls the event from which we are viewing, preventing us-now from becoming a candidate GC origin (7) Updating on not seeing alien volumes should also update one toward estimating an earlier rank, as earlier GC are less likely to see alien volumes. Even so, this does not weaken the inference from Figure 7 toward a high speed s. This analysis, like most in our paper, assumes we would have by now noticed differences between volumes controlled or not by GCs. Another possibility, however, is that GCs make their volumes look only subtly di erent, a difference that we have not yet noticed. If even so we would have noticed being inside a GC-controlled volume, then our model still applies, except that we can't use current data to constrain the expansion speed s. In this case, there could be hope for astronomers to search the sky for subtle circu- lar borders between GC volumes and surrounding volumes. Figures 8 and 9 show how predicted distributions over the number of GC volumes and the total length of such sky borders vary with speed sand powern. 23   Figure 15.

Unless stated otherwise, these each come from averaging over  ve simulation repetitions, each with W=s=c= 1 andN= 108sample GC origin events. Model-to-clock time mappings are made using only GCs who see no others at their origins, but all GCs are shown in the distributions, even GCs who do see others. Correctness of code has often been checked by comparing independent implementations. Figure 10 shows clock GC origin

RESPONSE:

This article discusses the concept of lightspeed c, GC origin events in the past lightcone, which would create a GC that controls the event from which we are viewing and prevents us from becoming a candidate GC origin. It also discusses how not seeing alien volumes should update one's estimation of an earlier rank, as earlier GCs are less likely to see alien volumes. The analysis assumes that we would have by now noticed differences between volumes controlled or not by GCs, but there is also the possibility that GCs make their volumes look only subtly different. If this is the case, then we can't use current data to constrain the expansion speed s. Figures 8 and 9 show how predicted distributions over the number of GC volumes and the total length of such sky borders vary with speed sand powern. Figure 15 shows the final galaxies per GC-controlled volume if GCs retain initial volumes after meeting, while Figure 16 shows the final galaxies per GC-controlled volume versus the origin time of each GC. Finally, Figure 10 shows clock GC origin events per volume as a function of volume power n and speed ratio s=c.
