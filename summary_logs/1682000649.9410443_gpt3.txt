average takes about ai, but each hard step (and also the time T E P itileft at the end) on average takes about ( T E)=(n+ 1), regardless of its diffculty ai. (Where E=P iaifor the easy steps.) And the chance of this unlikely completion is proportional toTn, wherenis the number of hard steps. It turns out that this same model was introduced in 1953 to describe the appearance of cancer, where it is now a standard model (43,22). To produce cancer, an inividual cell must host a sucient number of mutations, and the expected time for each mutation to appear in any one cell is much longer than the organism's lifetime. Even so, cancer often appears eventually at some cell in a large organism; humans have 31013cells, and 40% of us develop cancer. Human cancer typically requires 6-7 hard mutations, though sometimes as few as two. The power law in timing has been confirmed, and is sometimes used to infer the number of hard mutation steps. This basic hard steps model can be generalized in many ways. For example, in addition to these "try-try" steps with a constant per-time chance of success, we can add constant time delays (which in effect cut available time T) or add "try-once" steps, which succeed or fail immediately but allow no recovery from failure. These additions preserve the Tn functional form. We can also allow "multi" steps where the chance of completing step i within time ti goes as tni for a step specific ni. If all steps have this uniform (try-once steps areni= 0, while hard try-try steps are nearly ni= 1), then the nin theTnchance rule becomes n=P iniover all such steps i. (And Tn holds here exactly; it is not an approximation.) For example, a "try-menu-combo" step might require the creation of a species with a particular body design, such as the right sort of eye, hand, leg, stomach, etc. If the length of the available menu for each part (e.g., eye) increased randomly but linearly with time, and if species were created by randomly picking from the currently

RESPONSE:

This article discusses a model that was introduced in 1953 to explain the appearance of cancer, which is now a standard model. The model states that the average time for each hard step in a process to be completed is (T E)=(n+ 1), regardless of its difficulty. The chance of completing the process is proportional to Tn, where n is the number of hard steps. In the case of cancer, it typically requires 6-7 hard mutations, though sometimes as few as two. The power law in timing has been confirmed, and is sometimes used to infer the number of hard mutation steps. This model can be generalized in many ways, such as adding constant time delays or "try-once" steps. It can also allow "multi" steps where the chance of completing step i within time ti goes as tni for a step specific ni. If all steps have this uniform (try-once steps are ni= 0 and hard try-try steps are nearly ni= 1), then the n in the Tn chance rule becomes n=P iniover all such steps i. An example given is a "try-menu-combo" step which requires the creation of a species with a particular body design, such as the right sort of eye, hand, leg, stomach, etc. If the length of the available menu for each part increases randomly but linearly with time, and if species are created by randomly picking from the currently available menu, then this model would apply.
