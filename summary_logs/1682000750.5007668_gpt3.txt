RESPONSE:

This paper examines the percentile rank of today's 13.8 Gyr date within the predicted (t) distribution of advanced life arrival dates, according to Equation 1. It looks at how this rank varies with planet-power n, max planet lifetime L, SFR decay ', and mass-favoring power (MFP) . To do this, the authors first multiply the usual star mass c.d.f. by a factor m, to favor larger star habitability. This changes the planet lifetime c.d.f. to go as roughly H[L] =L(3 2)=6. Figure 2 shows how this percentile rank varies with planet-power n and max planet lifetime L, assuming habitable SFR decay'= 4, peak = 12 Gyr, and mass-favoring power (MFP) = 0. Figure 3 also shows how this percentile rank varies with SFR decay 'and mass-favoring power . The results show that the percentile rank of today's date is highly dependent on the parameters used in the equation and can vary significantly depending on their values.
