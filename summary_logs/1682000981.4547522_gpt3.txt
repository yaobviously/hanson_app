Note that the higher the volume-power, the more closely spaced are GC origin times, the fewer galaxies each GC encompasses, and the less time until our GC descendants would meet or see aliens. The earliest GCs tend to have the largest volumes. Out of all the figures in this paper, only Figures 10,12,12,14,16 depend on our assump- tion of a uniform distribution over humanity's origin rank among GCs.

RESPONSE:

This paper discusses the implications of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and the chances of success in SETI. It looks at grabby civilizations (GCs) and non-grabby civilizations (NGCs) and their origin dates, origin events, and volume fractions. It also looks at the clock durations until a GC descendant meets aliens, the largest alien volume angle seen, clock durations until a GC descendant sees aliens, and distributions over the number of galaxies per GC at the simulation end. The paper also considers how GC origin dates and volumes are related to each other. The paper provides two scenarios with specific numbers in Table 1. It concludes by discussing the implications for non-grabby civilizations, including their chances for soon birthing a GC, humanity's grabbiness in the next ten million years, and success in SETI.
