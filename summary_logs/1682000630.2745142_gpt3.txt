RESPONSE:

Brandon Carter introduced a 1983 statistical model of how civilizations like ours might arise from simple dead matter, via intermediate steps of simple life, complex life, etc. This model posits a sequence of required steps, each of which has a rate of being achieved given the achievement of its previous step. The average duration to achieve each step is proportional to the rate. This process starts at time t=0 when a planet first becomes habitable, and the model assumes that all steps are completed by time t=T. The steps are divided into two classes: easy steps with ai<T, and hard steps with ai>T. This model has been used to explain why advanced life on Earth appears early in the universe's history despite the potential obstacles of locking, solar flares, insuffcient early UV light, runaway greenhouses, and early loss of atmospheres and plate tectonics. It also builds a simple appearance model to show how the hard-steps process makes humanity's current date look early. Additionally, it changes coordinates to account for an expanding universe and shows that a power law often at least crudely approximates advanced life appearance. Finally, it makes specific predictions for grabby alien civilization times, distances, angles, speeds, and more, and also describes the constraints our model places on the relative frequency of non-grabby civilizations if they are to be visible to various SETI efforts.
