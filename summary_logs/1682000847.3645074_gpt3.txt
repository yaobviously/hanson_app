Write a detailed summary of the following:


assume that over time the c.d.f. chance of birth by tat some position vrises as (t=k)n, a volume-power nof time since t= 0 divided by a timescale constant k. Except that this per-time chance falls to zero as soon as the expanding volume of another GC includes this position v. There may in fact be civilizations born within GC volumes, but we decline to call them \grabby" to keep the GC concept relevant to human observations. As we discuss in Section 17.1, this power law dependence can be a robust feature of the origin of advanced civilizations. And that is our whole model. It has three free parameters: the speed sof expansion and the constant kand volume-power nof the appearance power law. It turns out that we can estimate each of these parameters at least roughly from data. Specific examples of the spacetime distribution resulting from this process are shown in Figure 1. Notice how smaller GC tend to be found at later origin times in the spatial \crevices" near where larger earlier GC would meet. (This correlation between origin date and size is explored in Figure 16.) For simplicity, these examples show each GC retaining control of its initial volume after GCs meet. This assumption is made for concreteness only; our analysis only depends on it when we show examples or find distributions over final GC volumes. 9 Heuristic 1D Model A simple deterministic model gives a rough approximation to this stochastic model in one dimension. Assume that a regular array of \constraining" GC origins all have the same origin time t=x, and are equally spaced so that neighboring expansion cones all intersect at t= 1. (See Figure 5.) If these cones set the deadline for the origins of other \arriving" GC, we can then find a distribution over arriving GC origin times that results from integrating the arrival power law tn 1over the regions allowed by the constraining GC. The key modeling assumption of this simplified heuristic model is to equate the con- straining GC origin time xwith

RESPONSE:

This article discusses a model that explains the chance of birth by time at some position vrises as (t=k)n, a volume-power nof time since t= 0 divided by a timescale constant k. This chance falls to zero when the expanding volume of another GC includes this position v. The model has three free parameters: the speed of expansion, the constant k, and the volume-power of the appearance power law. Examples of the spacetime distribution resulting from this process are shown in Figure 1. There is also a heuristic 1D model which gives a rough approximation to this stochastic model in one dimension. This model assumes that a regular array of \constraining" GC origins all have the same origin time t=x, and are equally spaced so that neighboring expansion cones all intersect at t= 1. This model then finds a distribution over arriving GC origin times that results from integrating the arrival power law tn 1over the regions allowed by the constraining GC. The key modeling assumption is to equate the constraining GC origin time xwith the speed of expansion and the constant k.
