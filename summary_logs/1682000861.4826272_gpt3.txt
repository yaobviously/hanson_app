RESPONSE:

This heuristic math model captures two key symmetries of a stochastic model, which are described in Section 11. It predicts the ratio of median time till meet aliens to the median GC origin time as (1 x)=xfor each volume-power n. This prediction is found to match a 1D simulation result at a percentile rank of 0:88 at n= 1, falling to a minimum of 0:61 atn= 4, and then rising up to 0:88 again at n= 24. The cosmology of the model has key objects maintaining constant spatial relations, yet our universe is expanding. To solve this problem, a change of coordinates is used, using "model" coordinates which are co-moving spatial positions du=dv=a(t) and conformal times d =dt=a(t). In terms of these coordinates, galaxies tend to stay near the same spatial positions, but a freely-falling object that starts at an initial speed  u= does not maintain that speed due to the expansion of the universe.
