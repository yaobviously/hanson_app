laws can describe the timing of advanced life appearance on individual planets. But how well can power laws approximate advanced life timing for much larger, perhaps galaxy-sized, co-moving volumes that contain changing mixes of planets? To explore this question, and to estimate human earliness, we now consider a somewhat more realistic model for the timing of the appearance of advanced life. In this model, stars form at different dates, planet lifetimes vary with star lifetimes, and only planets with lifetimesL < Lare suitable for advanced life. The probability density function f(t) of advanced life to appear at date t becomes (t) =qZt max(0;t L)(t b)n 1%(b)h H(L) H(t b)i db; (1) wherebis each star's birthdate, %(t) is a star formation rate (SFR), H[L] is a cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) over planet lifetimes, nis a planet-based hard steps c.d.f. power, and qis a normalization constant (to makeR1 0(t) = 1).

RESPONSE:

This article explores the question of how well power laws can approximate the timing of advanced life for larger, co-moving volumes that contain changing mixes of planets. To do this, the authors present a more realistic model for the timing of the appearance of advanced life. This model takes into account factors such as stars forming at different dates, planet lifetimes varying with star lifetimes, and only planets with lifetimes less than a certain amount being suitable for advanced life. The probability density function of advanced life to appear at date t is calculated using a star formation rate (SFR), a cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) over planet lifetimes, a planet-based hard steps c.d.f. power, and a normalization constant. The c.d.f. of stellar lifetimes is approximated as roughly H[L] =L0:5over an important range (up to a maximum star lifetime L2104Gyr). A large literature exists trying to estimate a general SFR, and while this literature embraces a wide range of functional forms, a common form is %(t) =te t=', which peaks at ='. The authors consider three decay times:'in 2;4;8 Gyr as plausible parameter estimates for the purposes of estimating advanced life timing. To calculate habitable SFRs%(t) and lifetime distributions H[L], the authors use an equation that takes into account the fraction of stars with habitable planets at any given time as well as the fraction of stars with planets that are in the habitable zone at any given time. The authors then use this equation to calculate the probability density function of advanced life appearing at any given time, and they find that power laws can approximate this probability density function quite well in all cases considered.
