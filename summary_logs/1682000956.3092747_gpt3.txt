model and compute the above statistics can be found at https://github.com/jonathanpaulson/grabby_aliens . 13 Estimating Expansion Speed Our grabby aliens model has three free parameters, and we have so far discussed empirical estimates of two of them: the volume-power n(in Sections 4 and 17.1) and the power law constant k(in Section 10). The remaining parameter, expansion speed s, can also be estimated empirically, via the datum that we humans today do not see alien volumes in our sky (5,6,7). We will see in Figure 13 that visible alien volumes are typically huge in the sky, much larger than the full moon. So there is only a tiny chance of a visible GC volume being too small to be seen by the naked eye, much less by our powerful telescopes. So if alien volumes looked noticeably different, as we assume in our definition of \grabby", and if their volumes intersected with our backwards light cone, then we should see them clearly. We will also see in Figure 11 that, averaging over GC origin dates, a third to a half of the volume of the universe is controlled by GCs. So from a random location at such dates, one is likely to see large alien-controlled volumes. However, if the GC expansion speed is a high enough fraction of the speed of light, a selection effect, illustrated in Figure 6, makes it unlikely for a random GC to see such an alien volume at its origin date. If they were where we could see them, then they would be here now instead of us. Given prior estimates regarding the chances for various combinations of power nand GC expansion speed ratio s=c, we can update such priors via the likelihood ratio of such a pair (n;s=c ) to predict our key evidence that we do not now see alien volumes. Figure 7 show that likelihood ratio, i.e., the number of GC origin events that see no alien volumes, divided by the number that do. Speed ratios of s=c < 1=3 are greatly disfavored, especially for high powers. 22   Figure 6. Illustration of selection effect. When expansion speeds

RESPONSE:

The model and computation of the statistics for grabby aliens can be found at https://github.com/jonathanpaulson/grabby_aliens. Estimating the expansion speed of the grabby aliens has three free parameters, two of which have been discussed empirically: the volume-power (n) and the power law constant (k). The remaining parameter, expansion speed (s), can be estimated empirically by the fact that humans do not see alien volumes in our sky. Visible alien volumes are typically much larger than the full moon, so it is unlikely for a random GC volume to be too small to be seen. It is also likely that a third to a half of the universe is controlled by GCs, so from a random location at such dates, one is likely to see large alien-controlled volumes. However, if the GC expansion speed is a high enough fraction of the speed of light, a selection effect makes it unlikely for a random GC to see such an alien volume at its origin date. Given prior estimates regarding the chances for various combinations of power n and GC expansion speed ratio s=c, a likelihood ratio can be used to predict our key evidence that we do not now see alien volumes. Speed ratios of s=c < 1=3 are greatly disfavored, especially for high powers.
