Examples include the spread of species and peoples into territories, diseases into populations, and innovations into communities of practice. Without wide coordination, processes that halt or reverse their spread locally only rarely stop their spread across very wide scales. Yes, expanding into the universe seems to us today a very dicult technical and social challenge, far beyond current abilities. Even so, many foresee a non-trivial chance that some of our distant descendants may be up to the challenge within ten million years. Furthermore, the large distances and times involved suggest that large scale coordination will be dicult, making it more plausible that uncoordinated local processes may aggre- gate into consistent overall trends. The spatial uniformity of the universe on large scales, and competitive pressures to expand faster, also suggest that such trends could result in a steady and universal expansion speed. Yes, perhaps there is only a tiny chance that any one civilization will fall into such a scenario wherein internal selection successfully promotes sustained rapid overall expan- sion. (We discuss such chances in Section 15.) Even so, the few exceptions could have a vastly disproportionate impact on the universe. If such expansions are at all possible, we should consider their consequences. 8 The Model Our basic model sits in a cosmology that is static relative to its coordinates.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This article discusses consistent trends, which are trends whose average rates are set by more fundamental constraints. Examples of these trends include the spread of species and peoples into territories, diseases into populations, and innovations into communities of practice. Without wide coordination, processes that halt or reverse their spread locally will rarely be able to stop their spread across very wide scales. The article suggests that there is a non-trivial chance that some of our distant descendants may be able to expand into the universe within ten million years. It also suggests that large scale coordination will be difficult, making it more plausible that uncoordinated local processes may aggregate into consistent overall trends. The article then discusses a model which sits in a cosmology that is static relative to its coordinates. It states that galaxies sit at constant spatial position vectors in a 3-dimensional space, time moves forward after t= 0, and movement at constant speed in the x coordinate direction satisfies s= x=t. The article also states that within this space, “grabby civilizations” (GC) spontaneously arise at spacetime events (v;t). By definition, GC volumes look clearly different, and consistently expand in all directions until they reach the boundaries of their neighbors.
