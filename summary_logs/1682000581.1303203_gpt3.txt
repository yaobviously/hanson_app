Write a detailed summary of the following:


half lightspeed the 1D diagram shows 61 GC across a spatial width of 2.8 Gpc, while the 2D diagram shows 144 GC within a width of 0.6 Gpc, both widths applying at the median GC birthdate if that is our current date of 13.8 Gyr. We show coordinates co-moving in space and conformal in time, as explained in Section 10. A three-dimensional movie visualisation is found at https://grabbyaliens.com.     Overview Ours is a model of "grabby" aliens, who by definition a) expand the volumes they control at a common speed, b) clearly change the look of their volumes (relative to uncontrolled volumes), c) are born according to a power law in time except not within other GC volumes, and d) do not die unless displaced by other GCs. See Figure 1 for examples of the space-time pattern produced by this model. GCs might allow other civilizations to be born within their volumes, but as those should clearly see that in-volume status, we exclude them from our GC de nition. Our assumptions reject the "zoo" hypothesis. Our model has three parameters, the first of which is the rate at which grabby civilizations are born. We assume that we humans have a non-zero chance of giving birth to a grabby civilization, and that, if this were to happen, it would happen within roughly ten million years. We also assume (with (6)) that this chance is space-time-representative, i.e., we have no good reason to expect our spacetime location to be unusual, relative to other GC origins. Given these assumptions, and the fact that we do not now seem to be within a clearly-changed alien volume, our current spacetime event becomes near a sample from the distribution of grabby civilization origins. That allows us to estimate the overall grabby birth rate to within roughly a factor of two (for its inter-quartile range), at least for powers of three or higher. Yes, it is possible, and perhaps even desirable, that our descendants do not become grabby. Even so, our current date remains a data point. Surprised? Imagine


DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This article presents a model of "grabby" aliens, which are defined as civilizations that expand the volumes they control at a common speed, and clearly change the look of their volumes (relative to uncontrolled volumes). These aliens are born according to a power law in time, and do not die unless displaced by other GCs. The model has three parameters, the first of which is the rate at which grabby civilizations are born. The authors assume that humans have a non-zero chance of giving birth to a grabby civilization, and that this chance is space-time-representative. This allows them to estimate the overall grabby birth rate to within roughly a factor of two (for its inter-quartile range). The authors present a 1D diagram showing 61 GC across a spatial width of 2.8 Gpc, while the 2D diagram shows 144 GC within a width of 0.6 Gpc, both widths applying at the median GC birthdate if that is our current date of 13.8 Gyr. A three-dimensional movie visualisation is also provided. Despite the possibility that our descendants do not become grabby, our current date remains a data point for estimating the overall grabby birth rate.
