If Loud Aliens Explain Human Earliness, Quiet Aliens Are Also Rare Robin Hanson, Daniel Martin, Calvin McCarter, Jonathan Paulson Abstract If life on Earth had to achieve "hard steps" to reach humanity's level, then the chance of this event rose as time to the n-th power. Integrating this over habitable star formation and planet lifetime distributions predicts >99% of advanced life appears after today, unless n < 3andmax planet duration <50Gyr. That is, we seem early. We offer this explanation: a deadline is set by "loud" aliens who are born according to a hard steps power law, expand at a common rate, change their volumes' appearances, and prevent advanced life like us from appearing in their volumes. "Quiet" aliens, in contrast, are much harder to see. We fit this three- parameter model of loud aliens to data: 1) birth power from the number of hard steps seen in Earth history, 2) birth constant by assuming a inform distribution over our rank among loud alien birth dates, and 3) expansion speed from our not seeing alien volumes in our sky. We estimate that loud alien civilizations now control 40- 50% of universe volume, each will later control 105- 3x107galaxies, and we could meet them in 200Myr { 2Gyr. If loud aliens arise from quiet ones, a depressingly low transition chance ( <10 4) is required to expect that even one other quiet alien civilization has ever been active in our galaxy. Which seems bad news for SETI. But perhaps alien volume appearances are subtle, and their expansion speed lower, in which case we predict many long circular arcs to find in our sky.    Introduction To a First approximation, there are two kinds of aliens: quiet and loud. Loud (or expansive) aliens expand fast, last long, and make visible changes to their volumes. Quiet aliens fail to meet at least one of these criteria. As quiet aliens are harder to see, we are forced to accept rather uncertain estimates of their density, via methods like the Drake equation.

RESPONSE:

This paper examines the possibility of two types of alien life: loud and quiet. Loud aliens are those that expand quickly, last long, and make visible changes to their volumes. Quiet aliens, on the other hand, fail to meet at least one of these criteria. The paper attempts to explain why humanity appears to be so early in the universe by proposing a model of loud aliens that prevent advanced life from appearing in their volumes. To fit this three-parameter model of loud aliens to data, the authors use the number of hard steps seen in Earth history as a birth power, assume a uniform distribution over our rank among loud alien birth dates as a birth constant, and use our not seeing alien volumes in our sky as an expansion speed. They estimate that loud alien civilizations now control 40-50% of universe volume, each will later control 105-3x107galaxies, and we could meet them in 200Myr { 2Gyr. They also suggest that if loud aliens arise from quiet ones, a depressingly low transition chance ( <10 4) is required to expect that even one other quiet alien civilization has ever been active in our galaxy. The paper concludes by suggesting that alien volume appearances may be subtle and their expansion speed lower, which would mean we would be able to find many long circular arcs in our sky.
