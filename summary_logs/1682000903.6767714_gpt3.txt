its stochastic pattern of GC space-time origins, when expressed in model coordinates. First, halving the speed sof expansion halves the average spatial distance between GC, but otherwise preserves their relative spacetime pattern. (Though this can change parameters that depend on this speed srelative toc, such which GC can see what other GC.) Second, changing timescale kchanges the median GC origin time, but preserves the pattern once times and distances are rescaled by the same factor to give the same median origin time as before. (This even preserves who-can-see-who relations.) Thus simulations need only vary dimension Dand volume-power n, and repeatedly sample, to see the full range of stochastic GC origin patterns that can be produced by this model. This ability to explore its full range is one of the main virtues of our admitedly oversimplified model. So we can fix expansion speed at s= 1, focus on a unit time range [0 ;1] and spatial volume [0;W]D, and use a "wrap around" (toroidal) metric which identifies x= 0 with x=W, etc. in all spatial dimensions. ( W1 seems wise, and W= 1 usually seems fine; in Section 17.2 we check for robustness to this choice.) We generate Ncandidate GC origins ( u;) as (uniformly) random positions uwithin this unit volume, paired with random times drawn from a c.d.f that goes as non [0;1].

RESPONSE:

This article discusses the stochastic pattern of GC space-time origins when expressed in model coordinates. It is found that halving the speed of expansion halves the average spatial distance between GC, but preserves their relative spacetime pattern. Similarly, changing the timescale changes the median GC origin time, but preserves the pattern once times and distances are rescaled by the same factor. To explore the full range of stochastic GC origin patterns that can be produced by this model, simulations need only vary dimension Dand volume-power n and repeatedly sample. To do this, the expansion speed is fixed at s= 1, and a unit time range [0 ;1] and spatial volume [0;W]D is used with a "wrap around" (toroidal) metric which identifies x= 0 with x=W, etc. in all spatial dimensions. Ncandidate GC origins ( u; ) are then generated as (uniformly) random positions uwithin this unit volume, paired with random times drawn from a c.d.f that goes as non [0;1]. Any members precluded by other members are filtered out, and the remaining set Cof origins then defines a stochastic sample from our model. The sample can be transformed into a sample with a differing speedsby rescaling all distances by the same factor to make the median origin time one.
