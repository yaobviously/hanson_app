literature that estimates the timing of the appear- ance of advanced life has only once included the key hard-steps timing power law. In Section 5 we have presented a simple model which includes this effect, and in Section 6 we find that according to this model humanity today seems to be quite early, unless one assumes both a rather low planet-power anda very restrictive limit on habitable planet lifetimes. Related literatures have also apparently not considered applying this hard-steps-based power law to larger volumes like galaxies, instead of to just planets. Sterilizing explosions reduced galactic habitability eons ago, and some have suggested that this supports a scenario wherein advanced civilizations are far more common today than they were eons ago (40). But such authors do not seem to have realized that, with a suciently high power, a volume-based hard steps power law directly produces a similar effect. Nor do most prior authors seem to have noticed that a scenario wherein advanced civilizations grab most of the available volumes can robustly explain humanity's early arrival. While others have offered explanations based on the assumption that the evolution advanced life must follow a path close to Earth's path, our deadline explanation allows for a very wide range of evolutionary paths and contexts. To formalize this argument, we have presented in this paper a very simple model (plausibly over-simplified in fact) of what we call \grabby" civilizations (GC), a model that is a modest variation on models by S. Jay Olson, who recently pursued a similar approach, minus the hard steps power law (5,6,7,8,9,10). In our model, GCs are born according to a volume-based power law, and once born they simply expand at a constant speed relative to local materials. We show that this power law is often at least a crude approximation to a more realistic model. This expansion speed and the two parameters of this power law are the only three parameters of our model, each of

RESPONSE:

This paper discusses the timing of the appearance of advanced life and how it relates to the hard-steps timing power law. It presents a simple model which includes this effect, and finds that according to this model humanity today seems to be quite early, unless one assumes both a rather low planet-power and a very restrictive limit on habitable planet lifetimes. The paper also suggests that sterilizing explosions reduced galactic habitability eons ago, and some have suggested that this supports a scenario wherein advanced civilizations are far more common today than they were eons ago. However, authors have not considered applying this hard-steps-based power law to larger volumes like galaxies. The paper then introduces a model of what they call “grabby” civilizations (GC), which is a variation on models by S. Jay Olson. This model includes three parameters: expansion speed, and two parameters of the power law. It is argued that this power law is often at least a crude approximation to a more realistic model. The paper then discusses how this model can robustly explain humanity's early arrival, as it allows for a wide range of evolutionary paths and contexts.
