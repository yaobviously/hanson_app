which can be estimated from data to within roughly a factor of four. The hard-steps in Earth history literature helps to estimate the power, and our current date helps to estimate the power law timescale. Furthermore, the fact that we do not now see large alien-controlled volumes in our sky, even though they should control much of the universe volume now, gives us our last estimate, that aliens expand at over half of lightspeed. Given estimates of all three parameters, we have in this paper shown many model predictions regarding alien timing, spacing, appearance, and the durations until we see or meet them. And we have shown how optimism regarding humanity's future is in conflict with optimism regarding SETI efforts. Being especially simple, our model is unlikely to be an exact representation of reality. So future research might explore more realistic variations. For example, one might more precisely account for the recent exponential expansion of the universe, and use a more accurate appearance function instead of our power law approximation. Instead of being uniform across space, the GCs birth rate might be higher within galaxies, higher within larger galaxies, and follow their typical spatial distributions. A GC expansion might take a duration to bring its full effect to any one location, and the GC expansion speed might vary and depend on local geographies of resources and obstacles. Finally, GC subvolumes might sometimes stop expanding or die, either spontaneously or in response to local disturbances. Note, however, that in many cases we may not have data available to estimate the extra parameters that these extended models would introduce. A virtue of our over-simplified model is that we can estimate all its parameters using available data, and show the full range of variation of its behavior

RESPONSE:

This paper explores the power, timescale, and speed of alien expansion, which can be estimated from data to within roughly a factor of four. The hard-steps in Earth history literature is used to estimate the power, and our current date is used to estimate the power law timescale. Furthermore, the fact that we do not now see large alien-controlled volumes in our sky, even though they should control much of the universe volume now, gives us an estimate that aliens expand at over half of lightspeed. Predictions are made regarding alien timing, spacing, appearance, and the durations until we see or meet them. It is noted that optimism regarding humanity's future is in conflict with optimism regarding SETI efforts. The model used is simple and may not be an exact representation of reality; future research might explore more realistic variations. For example, one might more precisely account for the recent exponential expansion of the universe and use a more accurate appearance function instead of a power law approximation. Additionally, the GCs birth rate might vary based on local geographies of resources and obstacles. Finally, GC subvolumes might sometimes stop expanding or die due to local disturbances. The advantage of this over-simplified model is that all its parameters can be estimated using available data.
