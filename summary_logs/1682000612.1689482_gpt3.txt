like a galaxy. This volume-based power is our third key parameter. For each combination of our three estimated model parameters, we can fully describe the stochastic spacetime patterns of GC activity across the universe, allowing us to esti- mate, for example, where they are and when we would meet or see them. We will later show in detail how these distributions change with our model parameters. Our grabby aliens model can explain a striking empirical puzzle: why have we humans appeared so early in the universe? Yes, many calculations often find our date to be not greatly atypical of habitable durations undisturbed by nearby sterilizing explosions, for both short and long durations. Other calculations find us to be early, even if not extremely early, when planets at many lower mass stars are considered habitable. However, all but one of these calculations neglects the hard-steps power-law. When that is included, humans look much earlier, unless one makes strong assumptions about both the hard-steps power and the habitability of stars that last longer than our sun. (See Figure 3.) We will show this via a somewhat less simple appearance model, which applies the hard-steps power law to planets, allows stars to form at different dates, and allows their planets to last for different durations. Our grabby aliens model resolves this puzzle by denying a key assumption of this appearance model: that the birth of some advanced life has no effect on the chances that others are born at later dates. Our model instead embodies a selection effect: if grabby aliens will soon grab all the universe volume, that sets a deadline by which others must be born, if they are not to be born within an alien-controlled volume. Our deadline explanation for human earliness allows for a wide range of paths by which, and contexts in which, advanced life might appear. In contrast, many other explanations posit that planets around long-lifetime stars are just not habitable due to factors like tidal-

RESPONSE:

This paper presents a model, called the grabby aliens model, which explains why humans have appeared so early in the universe. The model is based on three parameters: a power law, a volume-based power, and a hard-steps power law. When these parameters are combined, they can fully describe the stochastic spacetime patterns of GC activity across the universe. This allows us to estimate where and when advanced life forms will appear. When the hard-steps power law is included, humans appear much earlier than when it is not included. The grabby aliens model resolves this puzzle by denying the assumption that the birth of some advanced life has no effect on the chances that others are born at later dates. Instead, it posits that if grabby aliens will soon grab all the universe volume, then this sets a deadline by which others must be born if they are not to be born within an alien-controlled volume. This explanation for human earliness allows for a wide range of paths and contexts in which advanced life might appear.
