PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:


that you are standing on a strange planet wondering how strong is its gravity. Your intuition tells you, from the way things seem to bounce and move around you, that you could probably jump about 1.3 meters here, compared to the usual 0.5 meters on Earth. Which suggests that you are on a planet with a gravity like Mars. And it suggests this even if you do not actually jump . A counterfactual number can be just as valid a data point as a real number. The second of our three model parameters is the (assumed universal) speed at which grabby civilizations expand. Our model predicts that on average at grabby origin dates, a third to a half of the universe is within grabby-controlled volumes. So if the grabby expansion speed were low, many such volumes should appear quite large and noticeable in our sky. However, as noted by (Olson '15; Olsen '17) and discussed in Section 13, if their expansion speed were within 25% of lightspeed, a selection effect implies that we are less likely to see than to not see such volumes. Thus if we could have seen them, they would likely be here now instead of us. As we do not now see such volumes, we conclude that grabby aliens, if they exist, expand very fast. The third of our three model parameters is a power derived from the effective number of hard steps" in the "great filter" process by which simple dead matter evolves to become a grabby civilization (12). It is well-known that the chance of this entire process completing within a time duration goes as the length of that duration raised to the power of the number of hard (i.e., take-very-long) steps (or their multi-step equivalents) in that evolutionary process. Using data on Earth history durations, a literature estimates an Earth-duration-based power to lie roughly near the range 3-9. Such hard-steps power-law models are usually applied to planets. However, we show in Section 17.1 that such a power law can also apply well to the chances of advanced life arising within a larger volume

RESPONSE:

This summary is about a model that suggests the existence of grabby aliens and their expansion speed. The model is based on three parameters: the gravity of the planet, the assumed universal speed of grabby civilizations expanding, and a power derived from the number of hard steps in the process of simple dead matter evolving to become a grabby civilization. The gravity of the planet can be determined by intuition, without actually jumping, by observing how things move around you. The model predicts that on average at grabby origin dates, a third to a half of the universe is within grabby-controlled volumes. If their expansion speed were within 25% of lightspeed, a selection effect implies that we are less likely to see such volumes. As we do not now see such volumes, we conclude that grabby aliens, if they exist, expand very fast. The third parameter is a power derived from the number of hard steps in the evolutionary process. Using data on Earth history durations, a literature estimates an Earth-duration-based power to lie roughly near the range 3-9. This power law can also apply well to the chances of advanced life arising within a larger volume.
