eliminating low mass stars entirely from consideration. However, to infer strict habitability limits from specific ways in which planets around low mass stars are not like Earth, such as tidal-locking, one needs to assume that advanced life can only arise through a narrow range of paths similar to the path that it took on Earth. If instead advanced life can arise through many difiierent paths across a wide range of environments, then low-mass-star-planet conditions that make it harder for such planets to follow Earth's path do not strongly eliminate such stars from consideration. For example, a large fraction of planets seem to be ocean worlds, for which most of the mentioned problems seem largely irrelevant (57, 58, 59). Earth seems to have long been an ocean world (60). And life may also be possible around binary stars, or even near and within brown dwarves (61,62,63). Our loud alien hypothesis instead offers an explanation for human earliness that allows for a wide range of paths to advanced life.

RESPONSE:

Low mass stars are often disregarded when considering habitability limits, as it is assumed that advanced life can only arise through a narrow range of paths similar to the path that it took on Earth. However, if advanced life can arise through many different paths across a wide range of environments, then low-mass-star-planets may not be as strongly eliminated from consideration. For example, a large fraction of planets seem to be ocean worlds, and life may also be possible around binary stars or near and within brown dwarves. The loud alien hypothesis offers an explanation for human earliness that allows for a wide range of paths to advanced life. Using the integral over star birthdate of Equation 1, it can be determined that for maximum lifetimes Lover20 Gyr, less than 10% of stars are born as late as our Sun, unless power n 4. This suggests either relatively low planet-powers n, or for panspermia, which favors higher powers and requires a later Sun birthdate to fit in a earlier star with a planet at which some hard steps were achieved before Earth.
