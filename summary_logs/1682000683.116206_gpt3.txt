then gives evalues of 3:9 and 12:5 (range 5:7 to 26), suggesting a middle estimate of at least 6. The relevant power nthat applies to our grabby aliens model can differ from this numbere. For example, it becomes smaller if evolution on Earth saw many delay steps, or big ones, such as from many easy steps, in effect reducing Earth's 5:4 Gyr time window to complete hard steps. But the relevant number of hard steps becomes larger than thiseif there were hard steps before Earth, or if there will be future hard steps between us today and a future grabby stage. Note that the enormous complexity and sophistication of even the simplest and earliest biology of which we know suggests to us that there may have been hard steps before Earth, which could be plausibly accommodated via panspermia (47,48,49). Similarly, the many obstacles to becoming grabby allow for future filters before our descendants can reach that stage. While calcuations in this paper will assume that any future  lters are try-once or short delay steps, it would be straightforward (if effortful) to redo these calculations given specific assumptions about future long delays or hard steps. Two more corrections are relevant to the power nthat applies to our grabby aliens model. First, Section 17.2 suggests that this paper's simplifying assumption of a power law expansion of the universe underestimates the effective volume-power regarding the space-time distributions of events by roughly a factor of three, because our actual universe has recently been transitioning toward exponential expansion. Second, Section 17.1 shows that while a power law also applies to volumes like galaxies, not just planets, that volume- power tends to be larger than the planet-based power. In the following, we will take volume power n= 6 as our conservative middle estimate, and consider nin 3 to 12 as our plausible range, though at times we also consider nas low as 1 and as high as 50. 5 Advanced Life Timing We've just seen how power

RESPONSE:

This paper discusses the power n that applies to our grabby aliens model and how it can differ from the number 3:9 and 12:5 (range 5:7 to 26) suggested as a middle estimate of at least 6. It is possible that this number could be smaller if evolution on Earth saw many delay steps, or larger if there were hard steps before Earth or future hard steps between us today and a future grabby stage. Additionally, the paper suggests that the simplifying assumption of a power law expansion of the universe underestimates the effective volume-power regarding the space-time distributions of events by roughly a factor of three, and that the volume-power tends to be larger than the planet-based power. The paper takes volume power n= 6 as its conservative middle estimate and considers n in 3 to 12 as its plausible range, though at times it also considers n as low as 1 and as high as 50. The paper then moves on to discuss Advanced Life Timing and how it can be used to estimate when advanced life may arise. It suggests that if we assume that advanced life arises in a manner similar to Earth's evolution, then we can use Earth's timeline as a basis for estimating when advanced life may arise in other parts of the universe. Finally, the paper concludes by discussing the implications of its findings for SETI and other related fields.
