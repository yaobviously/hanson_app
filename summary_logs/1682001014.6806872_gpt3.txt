At our middle estimate volume power of n= 6, a NGC to GC ratio of over one thou- sand is required to expect even one NGC active on our past light cone, and a ratio of over ten thousand is required to expect one anywhere in the past of our galaxy. Furthermore, a ratio of over ten million is required to expect one NGC active now in our galaxy. (And that's for a million year NGC lifetime; shorter lived NGCs require even higher ratios).

This model seems to roughly fit, and supports inferences about the number of hard steps so far experienced on Earth. While some argue that other processes besides hard steps also happened (like the easy, delay, try-once, and multi-try steps discussed in Section 3), we know of no published cricitism of the basic idea that some hard steps occured.

RESPONSE:

The literature has modeled the evolution of life on Earth as a sequence of "hard steps", which have been compared to Earth's historical record and found to roughly fit. This model is widely accepted, but it has not been taken seriously enough. For example, the ratio of Next Generation Civilizations (NGCs) to Galactic Civilizations (GCs) has not been considered in the context of SETI optimism. This ratio, R, is important for SETI optimism because higher powers usually require lower ratios R, and thus offer more room for SETI optimism. However, a NGC to GC ratio of over one thousand is required to expect even one NGC active on our past light cone, and a ratio of over ten thousand is required to expect one anywhere in the past of our galaxy. Furthermore, a ratio of over ten million is required to expect one NGC active now in our galaxy. Today SETI struggles to see NGC techno-signatures for even a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy, making these results discouraging for SETI. The "self indication" prior for indexical probability analysis favors larger values of R in proportion to R, at least relative to the chances that one might estimate neglecting anthropic considerations. Additionally, GC-controlled volumes are mostly empty and probably transparent, and we may not yet know how to see their differences. Overall, this suggests that the standard hard-steps model should be taken more seriously when considering SETI optimism.
