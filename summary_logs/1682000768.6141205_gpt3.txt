DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Equation 1 provides dates for the combination of MFP and SFR decay. Six diagrams in Figure 2 and 3 show the effects of the power law on substantial powers, as well as the modest differences made by changes to habitable SFR decay and MFP. For MFP = 0, percentile rank is always below 1% for max lifetimes beyond a trillion years, regardless of other parameters. For MFP = 3 and planet-power n > 1.5, all percentile ranks are <10.6%. For planet-power n = 3 and max lifetime L = 15Gyr, all ranks are <10%. And for planet-power n = 2 and max lifetime L = 20, all ranks are <8.4% when MFP = 0 and <12.4% when MFP = 3. These results suggest that humans have appeared surprisingly early in the history of the universe, unless one is willing to assume low powers n and restrictive max planet lifetimes L. Some have tried to explain this puzzle by suggesting that planets at low mass stars are less habitable due to tidal-locking, solar flares, insufficient early UV light, runaway greenhouses, and early loss of atmospheres and plate tectonics. However, merely favoring higher mass stars by large factors is not enough to solve the puzzle; something closer to a full solution is needed.
