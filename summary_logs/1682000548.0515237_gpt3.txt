contrast, are far more noticeable if they exist at any substantial density. Loud aliens are thus much better suited for empirical study via  tting simple models to available data. One prior researcher, S. Jay Olson, has recently pursued this approach. Olson estimated loud alien expansion speeds from the fact that we do not see now see them big in our sky, and he estimated their overall appearance rate by assuming humanity's current date to be a representative loud alien birthdate. Olson required only one further input to estimate a full stochastic spacetime distribution over loud aliens, which was a somewhat complex appearance function, specifying the distribution of loud alien birthdates over time. In this paper, we explore an even simpler model of loud aliens, whom we call "grabby," that we also fit to available data. Like Olson's, our model includes an expansion speed and an overall appearance rate, which we estimate similarly to Olson. But for an appearance function we use a simple power law, which has only one additional free parameter, its powern. This power law comes from the standard hard-steps statistical model of the origin of advanced life within a limited planetary time window, and its power comes from the number of hard steps" in the evolution of advanced life, a number that has been roughly estimated from the history of major events in Earth history to be near the range 3 to 9. Yes, this simpler appearance function is a cruder approximation, but its simplicity can let us better understand and apply it. We will show that a power law at least crudely approximates a more realistic appearance function for large fraction of the relevant parameter space. We will also show that, unless one assumes fewer than two hard steps and alsoa very restrictive limit on habitable planet lifetimes, one must conclude that humanity seems to have appeared implausibly early in the history of the universe. Loud aliens, who fill the universe early, can robustly explain human

RESPONSE:

In this paper, the authors explore a simpler model of loud aliens, referred to as "grabby", and use it to fit available data. This model includes an expansion speed and an overall appearance rate, which are estimated similarly to prior researcher S. Jay Olson. The authors use a simple power law as the appearance function, which has one additional free parameter - its power. This power law comes from the standard hard-steps statistical model of the origin of advanced life within a limited planetary time window, and its power is derived from the number of hard steps in the evolution of advanced life, which has been estimated to be in the range 3 to 9. The authors show that a power law at least crudely approximates a more realistic appearance function for a large fraction of the relevant parameter space. They also conclude that unless one assumes fewer than two hard steps and a very restrictive limit on habitable planet lifetimes, humanity appears to have appeared implausibly early in the universe. Loud aliens, who fill the universe early, can robustly explain this phenomenon.
