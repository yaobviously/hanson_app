Write a detailed summary of the following:


available menus for 7each part, then the chance of completing this try-menu-combo step within time tigoes as tni i, whereniis the number of different body parts needed to be of the right sort. We also retain this Tnform if we sum over different planets (or parts of planets) with different constants multiplying their Tn, for example due to different volumes of biological activity, or due to different metabolisms per unit volume. We could even sum over large volumes like a galaxy. Such models can allow for many sorts of \oases" wherein life might appear and evolve, not just planets. And similar models can accommodate a wide range of degrees of isolation versus mixing between these different parts and volumes. This set of model elements can be combined in many ways to model different relevant processes. For example, a time delay plus a try-once step can roughly model a case where life on a planet dies unless it achieves a particular development within a limited time window. Such as perhaps Earth having had only a billion year window to construct habitable niches and a matching Gaian regulation system (44). If this delay-plus-try- once process could happen in parallel with a sequence of hard steps, then this is nearly equivalent to adding a single try-once step to that sequence of hard steps. 4 How Many Hard Steps? A literature tries to estimate the number of (equivalent) hard steps passed so far in Earth's history from key durations. Here is an illustrative calculation. The two most plausibly diagnostic Earth durations seem to be the one remaining after now before Earth becomes uninhabitable for complex life, 1:1 Gyr, (45), and the one from when Earth was nearrst habitable to when life first appeared, 0:4 Gyr (range 0 :2 to 0:8 Gyr (46)). Assuming that only ehard steps have happened on Earth so far (with no delays or easy steps), the expected value aifor each of these durations should be 5:4Gyr=(e+ 1). Solving for eusing the observed durations of 1 :1 and 0:4 Gyr

RESPONSE:

This article discusses the possibility of constructing a model that can account for the emergence of life on Earth. It explains that the model should include different elements such as available menus for each part, the chance of completing this try-menu-combo step within time, and different constants multiplying their Tn due to different volumes of biological activity or due to different metabolisms per unit volume. The article then goes on to estimate the number of equivalent hard steps passed so far in Earth's history from key durations, such as the one remaining after now before Earth becomes uninhabitable for complex life, and the one from when Earth was nearrst habitable to when life first appeared. It is assumed that only ehard steps have happened on Earth so far (with no delays or easy steps). The expected value aifor each of these durations should be 5:4Gyr=(e+ 1). Solving for eusing the observed durations of 1 :1 and 0:4 Gyr gives an estimate of 8 hard steps passed so far in Earth's history.
