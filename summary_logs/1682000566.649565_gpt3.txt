earliness, as they set a deadline by which advanced life must appear if it is to see an empty universe as we do. Unlike other explanations offered, this one does not require assuming that advanced life can only result from evolutionary paths close to ours. As each of our three model parameters is estimable to within roughly a factor of four, we can and do estimate the stochastic spacetime distribution of grabby aliens, and thus distributions over grabby alien densities, origin dates, visible angles, and durations until we meet or see them. We also consider the alternate assumption that we have not yet noticed subtle appearance differences that mark the volumes they control, and for this scenario we estimate how common in the sky would be the volume borders for which astronomers might search. If we assume that grabby civilizations arise from more-common non-grabby versions, then the higher the chance pof this non-grabby to grabby transition, the less common can be such non-grabby versions. We will show that, assuming a generous million year average duration for non-grabby civilizations, depressingly low transition chances pare needed to estimate that even one other one was ever active anywhere along our past lightcone (p<10 3) , has ever existed in our galaxy ( p< 10**4) , or is active now in our galaxy ( p< 10**7) . Such low chances would bode badly for humanity's future.     Figure 1. These two diagrams each show a sample stochastic outcome from a grabby aliens model, in one (1D) and two (2D) spatial dimensions. The top diagram shows space on the x-axis and time moving up the y-axis. The bottom diagram shows two spatial dimensions, with time moving downward into the box. In both cases, randomly-colored grabby civilizations (GCs) are each born at a spacetime event, expand in forward-time cones, and then stop upon meeting another GC. The scenarios shown are for a clock-time volume-power nof 6. This would look the same for any expansion speed, but if it is at one

RESPONSE:

This paper presents a new explanation for the Fermi Paradox, which states that if advanced life is common in the universe, then why have we not seen any evidence of it yet? This new explanation suggests that advanced life is present in the universe, but is not detectable due to its "grabby" nature. This means that it has the ability to control large volumes of space-time and thus remain undetected. The paper then estimates the stochastic spacetime distribution of grabby aliens, and thus distributions over grabby alien densities, origin dates, visible angles, and durations until we meet or see them. It also considers the alternate assumption that we have not yet noticed subtle appearance differences that mark the volumes they control, and for this scenario it estimates how common in the sky would be the volume borders for which astronomers might search. The paper then concludes that if one assumes a generous million year average duration for non-grabby civilizations, depressingly low transition chances are needed to estimate that even one other one was ever active anywhere along our past lightcone (p< 10^3), has ever existed in our galaxy (p< 10^4), or is active now in our galaxy (p< 10^7). Such low chances would bode badly for humanity's future. The paper also provides diagrams of a sample stochastic outcome from a grabby aliens model in one (1D) and two (2D) spatial dimensions.
