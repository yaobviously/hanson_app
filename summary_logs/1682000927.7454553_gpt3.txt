Write a detailed summary of the following:

(Alternatively, we might call this a GC's \volume when meet neighbors".) Iterating through the GC, a distribution over galaxies per GC can be found for different times, as can the volume fraction of the universe which is controlled by GCs at that GC origin time .

RESPONSE:

This article discusses the potential of galaxies and galaxy clusters (GCs) in our universe. It explains that when two GCs meet, the first one to arrive is V < 1. It also explains that we can find a distribution over galaxies per GC for different times, as well as the volume fraction of the universe which is controlled by GCs at that GC origin time. Additionally, we can collect a two-dimensional distribution showing the relation between GC origin times and galaxies per GC. The article then goes on to explain that for each GC origin position, we can find the model time at which a speed s= 1 traveler would arrive at that position from each other GC origin event. The minimum of these is the arrival time when the first other GC expansion wave would, if allowed, arrive at this GC position. The model time average of that min arrival time and this GC origin time is the meet time, when the two GC expansion waves would collide (if both were in fact GCs). The article also explains that if a GC has not yet seen any other GC, it will first see the GC that it will first meet, and see it before their meeting for s < c . Furthermore, it explains that if banddare the (model) time and space distances between two GC origins, then fors= 1 ifd<cb the earlier one would be visible to the later one.
