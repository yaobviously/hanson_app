Write a detailed summary of the following:


from among all stars only those suitable for hosting advanced life. And a habitable lifetime distribution H[L] describes the durations of habitability of planets, not their durations of existence. A "galactic habitable zone" literature tries to estimate star habitability as a function of galactic position and time, in part by considering rates of nearby sterilizing explosions such as supernovae and gamma ray bursts (24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35). While such explosions are much less damaging to simpler life (53), in this paper we accept the usual assumption of no panspermia, and thus require habitable planets to support complex life, which is more fragile. As this literature has focused on advising SETI efforts, it has focused mostly on dates before today. But it almost always finds peak dates much later than the canonical SFR peak of= 4 Gyr, and as often as not finds peak dates after our current date of 13 :8 Gyr. We conservatively approximate typical results of this literature by retaining for our habitable% (t) the SFR functional form %(t) =te t=', but now with a habitable peak of = 12 Gyr and combining this with the three plausible SFR decay times: 'in 2;4;8 Gyr. In this literature, the early rise to a peak often seems convex, fitting  > 1. The appendix also considers varying this peak in 4;8;12 Gyr. (Our approach here of representing habitability via a habitable star formation rate in effect marks most early-universe stars as entirely unsuitable for life due to overly frequent nearby explosions. A more precise calculation would consider each star's specific duration lengths between such explosions.) A related literature asks how the habitable planet lifetime distribution H[L] relates to the raw star lifetime distribution. Many suggest that low mass star planets are not habitable due to ways in which they tend to differ from Earth. For example, such planets tend to suffer more that Earth from tidal-locking, solar flares, insucient early UV light,

RESPONSE:

This paper discusses the habitability of stars and the duration of habitability of planets. It looks at the "galactic habitable zone" literature which estimates star habitability as a function of galactic position and time, taking into account the rate of nearby sterilizing explosions like supernovae and gamma ray bursts. It finds that peak habitability dates are often much later than the canonical SFR peak of 4 Gyr and as often as not finds peak dates after the current date of 13.8 Gyr. The paper conservatively approximates typical results by retaining for its habitable% (t) the SFR functional form %(t) =te t=', but now with a habitable peak of = 12 Gyr and combining this with three plausible SFR decay times: 'in 2;4;8 Gyr. It also considers varying this peak in 4;8;12 Gyr. Additionally, it looks at how the habitable planet lifetime distribution H[L] relates to the raw star lifetime distribution, noting that low mass star planets are not usually considered habitable due to their tendency to differ from Earth in various ways, such as tidal-locking, solar flares, and insucient early UV light.
