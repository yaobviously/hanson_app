This paper examines the possibility of two types of alien life: loud and quiet. Loud aliens are those that expand quickly, last long, and make visible changes to their volumes. Quiet aliens, on the other hand, fail to meet at least one of these criteria. The paper attempts to explain why humanity appears to be so early in the universe by proposing a model of loud aliens that prevent advanced life from appearing in their volumes. To fit this three-parameter model of loud aliens to data, the authors use the number of hard steps seen in Earth history as a birth power, assume a uniform distribution over our rank among loud alien birth dates as a birth constant, and use our not seeing alien volumes in our sky as an expansion speed. They estimate that loud alien civilizations now control 40-50% of universe volume, each will later control 105-3x107galaxies, and we could meet them in 200Myr { 2Gyr. They also suggest that if loud aliens arise from quiet ones, a depressingly low transition chance ( <10 4) is required to expect that even one other quiet alien civilization has ever been active in our galaxy. The paper concludes by suggesting that alien volume appearances may be subtle and their expansion speed lower, which would mean we would be able to find many long circular arcs in our sky.

In this paper, the authors explore a simpler model of loud aliens, referred to as "grabby", and use it to fit available data. This model includes an expansion speed and an overall appearance rate, which are estimated similarly to prior researcher S. Jay Olson. The authors use a simple power law as the appearance function, which has one additional free parameter - its power. This power law comes from the standard hard-steps statistical model of the origin of advanced life within a limited planetary time window, and its power is derived from the number of hard steps in the evolution of advanced life, which has been estimated to be in the range 3 to 9. The authors show that a power law at least crudely approximates a more realistic appearance function for a large fraction of the relevant parameter space. They also conclude that unless one assumes fewer than two hard steps and a very restrictive limit on habitable planet lifetimes, humanity appears to have appeared implausibly early in the universe. Loud aliens, who fill the universe early, can robustly explain this phenomenon.

This paper presents a new explanation for the Fermi Paradox, which states that if advanced life is common in the universe, then why have we not seen any evidence of it yet? This new explanation suggests that advanced life is present in the universe, but is not detectable due to its "grabby" nature. This means that it has the ability to control large volumes of space-time and thus remain undetected. The paper then estimates the stochastic spacetime distribution of grabby aliens, and thus distributions over grabby alien densities, origin dates, visible angles, and durations until we meet or see them. It also considers the alternate assumption that we have not yet noticed subtle appearance differences that mark the volumes they control, and for this scenario it estimates how common in the sky would be the volume borders for which astronomers might search. The paper then concludes that if one assumes a generous million year average duration for non-grabby civilizations, depressingly low transition chances are needed to estimate that even one other one was ever active anywhere along our past lightcone (p< 10^3), has ever existed in our galaxy (p< 10^4), or is active now in our galaxy (p< 10^7). Such low chances would bode badly for humanity's future. The paper also provides diagrams of a sample stochastic outcome from a grabby aliens model in one (1D) and two (2D) spatial dimensions.

This article presents a model of "grabby" aliens, which are defined as civilizations that expand the volumes they control at a common speed, and clearly change the look of their volumes (relative to uncontrolled volumes). These aliens are born according to a power law in time, and do not die unless displaced by other GCs. The model has three parameters, the first of which is the rate at which grabby civilizations are born. The authors assume that humans have a non-zero chance of giving birth to a grabby civilization, and that this chance is space-time-representative. This allows them to estimate the overall grabby birth rate to within roughly a factor of two (for its inter-quartile range). The authors present a 1D diagram showing 61 GC across a spatial width of 2.8 Gpc, while the 2D diagram shows 144 GC within a width of 0.6 Gpc, both widths applying at the median GC birthdate if that is our current date of 13.8 Gyr. A three-dimensional movie visualisation is also provided. Despite the possibility that our descendants do not become grabby, our current date remains a data point for estimating the overall grabby birth rate.

This summary is about a model that suggests the existence of grabby aliens and their expansion speed. The model is based on three parameters: the gravity of the planet, the assumed universal speed of grabby civilizations expanding, and a power derived from the number of hard steps in the process of simple dead matter evolving to become a grabby civilization. The gravity of the planet can be determined by intuition, without actually jumping, by observing how things move around you. The model predicts that on average at grabby origin dates, a third to a half of the universe is within grabby-controlled volumes. If their expansion speed were within 25% of lightspeed, a selection effect implies that we are less likely to see such volumes. As we do not now see such volumes, we conclude that grabby aliens, if they exist, expand very fast. The third parameter is a power derived from the number of hard steps in the evolutionary process. Using data on Earth history durations, a literature estimates an Earth-duration-based power to lie roughly near the range 3-9. This power law can also apply well to the chances of advanced life arising within a larger volume.

This paper presents a model, called the grabby aliens model, which explains why humans have appeared so early in the universe. The model is based on three parameters: a power law, a volume-based power, and a hard-steps power law. When these parameters are combined, they can fully describe the stochastic spacetime patterns of GC activity across the universe. This allows us to estimate where and when advanced life forms will appear. When the hard-steps power law is included, humans appear much earlier than when it is not included. The grabby aliens model resolves this puzzle by denying the assumption that the birth of some advanced life has no effect on the chances that others are born at later dates. Instead, it posits that if grabby aliens will soon grab all the universe volume, then this sets a deadline by which others must be born if they are not to be born within an alien-controlled volume. This explanation for human earliness allows for a wide range of paths and contexts in which advanced life might appear.

Brandon Carter introduced a 1983 statistical model of how civilizations like ours might arise from simple dead matter, via intermediate steps of simple life, complex life, etc. This model posits a sequence of required steps, each of which has a rate of being achieved given the achievement of its previous step. The average duration to achieve each step is proportional to the rate. This process starts at time t=0 when a planet first becomes habitable, and the model assumes that all steps are completed by time t=T. The steps are divided into two classes: easy steps with ai<T, and hard steps with ai>T. This model has been used to explain why advanced life on Earth appears early in the universe's history despite the potential obstacles of locking, solar flares, insuffcient early UV light, runaway greenhouses, and early loss of atmospheres and plate tectonics. It also builds a simple appearance model to show how the hard-steps process makes humanity's current date look early. Additionally, it changes coordinates to account for an expanding universe and shows that a power law often at least crudely approximates advanced life appearance. Finally, it makes specific predictions for grabby alien civilization times, distances, angles, speeds, and more, and also describes the constraints our model places on the relative frequency of non-grabby civilizations if they are to be visible to various SETI efforts.

This article discusses a model that was introduced in 1953 to explain the appearance of cancer, which is now a standard model. The model states that the average time for each hard step in a process to be completed is (T E)=(n+ 1), regardless of its difficulty. The chance of completing the process is proportional to Tn, where n is the number of hard steps. In the case of cancer, it typically requires 6-7 hard mutations, though sometimes as few as two. The power law in timing has been confirmed, and is sometimes used to infer the number of hard mutation steps. This model can be generalized in many ways, such as adding constant time delays or "try-once" steps. It can also allow "multi" steps where the chance of completing step i within time ti goes as tni for a step specific ni. If all steps have this uniform (try-once steps are ni= 0 and hard try-try steps are nearly ni= 1), then the n in the Tn chance rule becomes n=P iniover all such steps i. An example given is a "try-menu-combo" step which requires the creation of a species with a particular body design, such as the right sort of eye, hand, leg, stomach, etc. If the length of the available menu for each part increases randomly but linearly with time, and if species are created by randomly picking from the currently available menu, then this model would apply.

This article discusses the possibility of constructing a model that can account for the emergence of life on Earth. It explains that the model should include different elements such as available menus for each part, the chance of completing this try-menu-combo step within time, and different constants multiplying their Tn due to different volumes of biological activity or due to different metabolisms per unit volume. The article then goes on to estimate the number of equivalent hard steps passed so far in Earth's history from key durations, such as the one remaining after now before Earth becomes uninhabitable for complex life, and the one from when Earth was nearrst habitable to when life first appeared. It is assumed that only ehard steps have happened on Earth so far (with no delays or easy steps). The expected value aifor each of these durations should be 5:4Gyr=(e+ 1). Solving for eusing the observed durations of 1 :1 and 0:4 Gyr gives an estimate of 8 hard steps passed so far in Earth's history.

This paper discusses the power n that applies to our grabby aliens model and how it can differ from the number 3:9 and 12:5 (range 5:7 to 26) suggested as a middle estimate of at least 6. It is possible that this number could be smaller if evolution on Earth saw many delay steps, or larger if there were hard steps before Earth or future hard steps between us today and a future grabby stage. Additionally, the paper suggests that the simplifying assumption of a power law expansion of the universe underestimates the effective volume-power regarding the space-time distributions of events by roughly a factor of three, and that the volume-power tends to be larger than the planet-based power. The paper takes volume power n= 6 as its conservative middle estimate and considers n in 3 to 12 as its plausible range, though at times it also considers n as low as 1 and as high as 50. The paper then moves on to discuss Advanced Life Timing and how it can be used to estimate when advanced life may arise. It suggests that if we assume that advanced life arises in a manner similar to Earth's evolution, then we can use Earth's timeline as a basis for estimating when advanced life may arise in other parts of the universe. Finally, the paper concludes by discussing the implications of its findings for SETI and other related fields.

This article explores the question of how well power laws can approximate the timing of advanced life for larger, co-moving volumes that contain changing mixes of planets. To do this, the authors present a more realistic model for the timing of the appearance of advanced life. This model takes into account factors such as stars forming at different dates, planet lifetimes varying with star lifetimes, and only planets with lifetimes less than a certain amount being suitable for advanced life. The probability density function of advanced life to appear at date t is calculated using a star formation rate (SFR), a cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) over planet lifetimes, a planet-based hard steps c.d.f. power, and a normalization constant. The c.d.f. of stellar lifetimes is approximated as roughly H[L] =L0:5over an important range (up to a maximum star lifetime L2104Gyr). A large literature exists trying to estimate a general SFR, and while this literature embraces a wide range of functional forms, a common form is %(t) =te t=', which peaks at ='. The authors consider three decay times:'in 2;4;8 Gyr as plausible parameter estimates for the purposes of estimating advanced life timing. To calculate habitable SFRs%(t) and lifetime distributions H[L], the authors use an equation that takes into account the fraction of stars with habitable planets at any given time as well as the fraction of stars with planets that are in the habitable zone at any given time. The authors then use this equation to calculate the probability density function of advanced life appearing at any given time, and they find that power laws can approximate this probability density function quite well in all cases considered.

This paper discusses the habitability of stars and the duration of habitability of planets. It looks at the "galactic habitable zone" literature which estimates star habitability as a function of galactic position and time, taking into account the rate of nearby sterilizing explosions like supernovae and gamma ray bursts. It finds that peak habitability dates are often much later than the canonical SFR peak of 4 Gyr and as often as not finds peak dates after the current date of 13.8 Gyr. The paper conservatively approximates typical results by retaining for its habitable% (t) the SFR functional form %(t) =te t=', but now with a habitable peak of = 12 Gyr and combining this with three plausible SFR decay times: 'in 2;4;8 Gyr. It also considers varying this peak in 4;8;12 Gyr. Additionally, it looks at how the habitable planet lifetime distribution H[L] relates to the raw star lifetime distribution, noting that low mass star planets are not usually considered habitable due to their tendency to differ from Earth in various ways, such as tidal-locking, solar flares, and insucient early UV light.

In this section, the authors discuss the concept of "runaway greenhouses, and early loss of atmospheres and plate tectonics" as potential problems for advanced civilizations. However, they also suggest that these problems may not be as severe as initially thought. To further explore this idea, the authors use an equation (1) which is often approximated by a power law. This power law is then used in their "grabby aliens" model to estimate the chance for an advanced civilization to arise in each volume by a certain date after the big bang. The authors then move on to discuss the concept of human earliness. They note that humans have arrived late relative to peak star formation, but early relative to habitable places and times. To estimate human earliness, they use two model parameters to represent variation in low mass star habitability and assume a maximum habitable planet lifetime of half of our sun's lifetime (L 10Gyr). They find that high powers greatly favor later arrival dates, making our current date look much earlier.

This paper examines the percentile rank of today's 13.8 Gyr date within the predicted (t) distribution of advanced life arrival dates, according to Equation 1. It looks at how this rank varies with planet-power n, max planet lifetime L, SFR decay ', and mass-favoring power (MFP) . To do this, the authors first multiply the usual star mass c.d.f. by a factor m, to favor larger star habitability. This changes the planet lifetime c.d.f. to go as roughly H[L] =L(3 2)=6. Figure 2 shows how this percentile rank varies with planet-power n and max planet lifetime L, assuming habitable SFR decay'= 4, peak = 12 Gyr, and mass-favoring power (MFP) = 0. Figure 3 also shows how this percentile rank varies with SFR decay 'and mass-favoring power . The results show that the percentile rank of today's date is highly dependent on the parameters used in the equation and can vary significantly depending on their values.

Equation 1 provides dates for the combination of MFP and SFR decay. Six diagrams in Figure 2 and 3 show the effects of the power law on substantial powers, as well as the modest differences made by changes to habitable SFR decay and MFP. For MFP = 0, percentile rank is always below 1% for max lifetimes beyond a trillion years, regardless of other parameters. For MFP = 3 and planet-power n > 1.5, all percentile ranks are <10.6%. For planet-power n = 3 and max lifetime L = 15Gyr, all ranks are <10%. And for planet-power n = 2 and max lifetime L = 20, all ranks are <8.4% when MFP = 0 and <12.4% when MFP = 3. These results suggest that humans have appeared surprisingly early in the history of the universe, unless one is willing to assume low powers n and restrictive max planet lifetimes L. Some have tried to explain this puzzle by suggesting that planets at low mass stars are less habitable due to tidal-locking, solar flares, insufficient early UV light, runaway greenhouses, and early loss of atmospheres and plate tectonics. However, merely favoring higher mass stars by large factors is not enough to solve the puzzle; something closer to a full solution is needed.

Low mass stars are often disregarded when considering habitability limits, as it is assumed that advanced life can only arise through a narrow range of paths similar to the path that it took on Earth. However, if advanced life can arise through many different paths across a wide range of environments, then low-mass-star-planets may not be as strongly eliminated from consideration. For example, a large fraction of planets seem to be ocean worlds, and life may also be possible around binary stars or near and within brown dwarves. The loud alien hypothesis offers an explanation for human earliness that allows for a wide range of paths to advanced life. Using the integral over star birthdate of Equation 1, it can be determined that for maximum lifetimes Lover20 Gyr, less than 10% of stars are born as late as our Sun, unless power n 4. This suggests either relatively low planet-powers n, or for panspermia, which favors higher powers and requires a later Sun birthdate to fit in a earlier star with a planet at which some hard steps were achieved before Earth.

This article discusses a model of advanced life origins that suggests a power law time dependence in the chances to originate advanced life in any one place due to evolution needing to pass through several difficult steps. It also suggests that civilizations have a tendency to expand fast, steadily, and indefinitely, changing how their volumes look in the process. This is due to competing species, cultures, and organizations having a tendency to expand into new territories and niches when possible in order to access resources that can aid reproduction. When aggregated to large enough scales, these uncoordinated local stochastic processes often result in relatively steady and predictable patterns. The article also provides evidence for the model by discussing how it accounts for observations and provides rationale for its key assumptions.

This article discusses consistent trends, which are trends whose average rates are set by more fundamental constraints. Examples of these trends include the spread of species and peoples into territories, diseases into populations, and innovations into communities of practice. Without wide coordination, processes that halt or reverse their spread locally will rarely be able to stop their spread across very wide scales. The article suggests that there is a non-trivial chance that some of our distant descendants may be able to expand into the universe within ten million years. It also suggests that large scale coordination will be difficult, making it more plausible that uncoordinated local processes may aggregate into consistent overall trends. The article then discusses a model which sits in a cosmology that is static relative to its coordinates. It states that galaxies sit at constant spatial position vectors in a 3-dimensional space, time moves forward after t= 0, and movement at constant speed in the x coordinate direction satisfies s= x=t. The article also states that within this space, “grabby civilizations” (GC) spontaneously arise at spacetime events (v;t). By definition, GC volumes look clearly different, and consistently expand in all directions until they reach the boundaries of their neighbors.

This paper examines the concept of Grabby Civilizations (GCs) and Non-Grabby Civilizations (NGCs). It is assumed that NGCs give birth to GCs within a short duration of their birth (less than 10 million years). It is also assumed that only one in R NGCs gives birth to a GC, and that this rate is independent of other parameters. Once a volume is controlled by a GC, it is assumed to be forever controlled by some GC and will look different from non-GC-controlled volumes. The paper also assumes that each small volume has the same uniform per-volume chance of a GC being born there, which is independent of the chances in other volumes. It is further assumed that once GCs meet, they might fight over volumes or maintain peaceful borders at their meeting locations. The paper also suggests that each GC might trigger a false vacuum decay soon after birth, in effect destroying the universe. The paper concludes by noting that its model is less accurate on smaller scales due to its uniformity assumption, which ignores the actual spatial clustering of galaxies.

This article discusses a model that explains the chance of birth by time at some position vrises as (t=k)n, a volume-power nof time since t= 0 divided by a timescale constant k. This chance falls to zero when the expanding volume of another GC includes this position v. The model has three free parameters: the speed of expansion, the constant k, and the volume-power of the appearance power law. Examples of the spacetime distribution resulting from this process are shown in Figure 1. There is also a heuristic 1D model which gives a rough approximation to this stochastic model in one dimension. This model assumes that a regular array of \constraining" GC origins all have the same origin time t=x, and are equally spaced so that neighboring expansion cones all intersect at t= 1. This model then finds a distribution over arriving GC origin times that results from integrating the arrival power law tn 1over the regions allowed by the constraining GC. The key modeling assumption is to equate the constraining GC origin time xwith the speed of expansion and the constant k.

This heuristic math model captures two key symmetries of a stochastic model, which are described in Section 11. It predicts the ratio of median time till meet aliens to the median GC origin time as (1 x)=xfor each volume-power n. This prediction is found to match a 1D simulation result at a percentile rank of 0:88 at n= 1, falling to a minimum of 0:61 atn= 4, and then rising up to 0:88 again at n= 24. The cosmology of the model has key objects maintaining constant spatial relations, yet our universe is expanding. To solve this problem, a change of coordinates is used, using "model" coordinates which are co-moving spatial positions du=dv=a(t) and conformal times d =dt=a(t). In terms of these coordinates, galaxies tend to stay near the same spatial positions, but a freely-falling object that starts at an initial speed  u= does not maintain that speed due to the expansion of the universe.

This passage discusses the concept of coordinate speed as it relates to the expanding universe. It explains that a Galactic Civilization (GC) might expand at a constant speed in a static universe, but in an expanding universe this is not the case. The passage then explains how to convert results from model time to clock time t, using the scale factor function a(t). It states that during the radiation-dominated era, the scale factor was ast1=2, and during the matter-dominated era it was ast2=3. In recent years, it has been slowly approaching e ta due to dark energy. It then explains how to convert between clock-time volume-power n and model-time volume-power  via =n=(1 m). Finally, it states that a least-squared-error fit of a power law to the actual a(t) within 0-20 Gyr after the Big Bang gives a best fit of m0:90, but for conservative analysis, m= 2=3 is used.

This paper explores the concept of converting distributions over model times (e.g., anF( ) over GC model origin times) into distributions over clock times t. This is done by assuming a uniform distribution over origin rank r, and using the current date of 13.8Gyr to estimate a distribution over the model timescale constant k. The paper also focuses on counting galaxies, as their number seems to be largely conserved on our timescales of concern, and galaxies tend to stay near the same co-moving spatial coordinates u. The current date is identified with model time in [0;1], and a speeds= 1 model box [0 ;1]3corresponds to proper volume of ( t0= )3(s=c)3Gpc3at that timet0. Thus the model box holds G=g(t0= )3(s=c)3galaxies at allmodel and clock times, and the model volume corresponding to one average galaxy is at all times 1 =G. The stochastic model scales in two ways: transformations of space-time coordinates, and transformations of probability distributions. These transformations are used to simulate events such as GC and NGC births.

This article discusses the stochastic pattern of GC space-time origins when expressed in model coordinates. It is found that halving the speed of expansion halves the average spatial distance between GC, but preserves their relative spacetime pattern. Similarly, changing the timescale changes the median GC origin time, but preserves the pattern once times and distances are rescaled by the same factor. To explore the full range of stochastic GC origin patterns that can be produced by this model, simulations need only vary dimension Dand volume-power n and repeatedly sample. To do this, the expansion speed is fixed at s= 1, and a unit time range [0 ;1] and spatial volume [0;W]D is used with a "wrap around" (toroidal) metric which identifies x= 0 with x=W, etc. in all spatial dimensions. Ncandidate GC origins ( u; ) are then generated as (uniformly) random positions uwithin this unit volume, paired with random times drawn from a c.d.f that goes as non [0;1]. Any members precluded by other members are filtered out, and the remaining set Cof origins then defines a stochastic sample from our model. The sample can be transformed into a sample with a differing speedsby rescaling all distances by the same factor to make the median origin time one.

This article discusses how to transform a spacetime event into samples with differing timescales by rescaling all times and distances by the same factor. It also explains how to calculate who can see who in a sample when the speed of light is varied relative to speed. Finally, it provides a list of simulation statistics that can be calculated within each run and averaged over multiple runs, such as a distribution over model GC origin times, a distribution over clock times, and a distribution over clock durations between model times. These statistics provide insight into how GCs are distributed in space and time.

This article discusses the potential of galaxies and galaxy clusters (GCs) in our universe. It explains that when two GCs meet, the first one to arrive is V < 1. It also explains that we can find a distribution over galaxies per GC for different times, as well as the volume fraction of the universe which is controlled by GCs at that GC origin time. Additionally, we can collect a two-dimensional distribution showing the relation between GC origin times and galaxies per GC. The article then goes on to explain that for each GC origin position, we can find the model time at which a speed s= 1 traveler would arrive at that position from each other GC origin event. The minimum of these is the arrival time when the first other GC expansion wave would, if allowed, arrive at this GC position. The model time average of that min arrival time and this GC origin time is the meet time, when the two GC expansion waves would collide (if both were in fact GCs). The article also explains that if a GC has not yet seen any other GC, it will first see the GC that it will first meet, and see it before their meeting for s < c . Furthermore, it explains that if banddare the (model) time and space distances between two GC origins, then fors= 1 ifd<cb the earlier one would be visible to the later one.

This paper examines the relationship between Globular Clusters (GCs) and Nuclear Globular Clusters (NGCs) in a Milky-Way-sized galaxy. It looks at the maximum angle each GC can see, the number of other GC origins that each GC can see, the total border length visible at each GC origin, and the NGC to GC ratio required to expect an active NGC visible in a Milky-Way-sized galaxy. It also looks at the clock time window of width [t0 L; t0] required for an NGC to be visible from Earth today, and the NGC to GC ratio required to expect one prior NGC anywhere in the past lightcone of a GC (or NGC) origin. Finally, it provides code to simulate the grabby alien.

The model and computation of the statistics for grabby aliens can be found at https://github.com/jonathanpaulson/grabby_aliens. Estimating the expansion speed of the grabby aliens has three free parameters, two of which have been discussed empirically: the volume-power (n) and the power law constant (k). The remaining parameter, expansion speed (s), can be estimated empirically by the fact that humans do not see alien volumes in our sky. Visible alien volumes are typically much larger than the full moon, so it is unlikely for a random GC volume to be too small to be seen. It is also likely that a third to a half of the universe is controlled by GCs, so from a random location at such dates, one is likely to see large alien-controlled volumes. However, if the GC expansion speed is a high enough fraction of the speed of light, a selection effect makes it unlikely for a random GC to see such an alien volume at its origin date. Given prior estimates regarding the chances for various combinations of power n and GC expansion speed ratio s=c, a likelihood ratio can be used to predict our key evidence that we do not now see alien volumes. Speed ratios of s=c < 1=3 are greatly disfavored, especially for high powers.

This article discusses the concept of lightspeed c, GC origin events in the past lightcone, which would create a GC that controls the event from which we are viewing and prevents us from becoming a candidate GC origin. It also discusses how not seeing alien volumes should update one's estimation of an earlier rank, as earlier GCs are less likely to see alien volumes. The analysis assumes that we would have by now noticed differences between volumes controlled or not by GCs, but there is also the possibility that GCs make their volumes look only subtly different. If this is the case, then we can't use current data to constrain the expansion speed s. Figures 8 and 9 show how predicted distributions over the number of GC volumes and the total length of such sky borders vary with speed sand powern. Figure 15 shows the final galaxies per GC-controlled volume if GCs retain initial volumes after meeting, while Figure 16 shows the final galaxies per GC-controlled volume versus the origin time of each GC. Finally, Figure 10 shows clock GC origin events per volume as a function of volume power n and speed ratio s=c.

This paper discusses the implications of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and the chances of success in SETI. It looks at grabby civilizations (GCs) and non-grabby civilizations (NGCs) and their origin dates, origin events, and volume fractions. It also looks at the clock durations until a GC descendant meets aliens, the largest alien volume angle seen, clock durations until a GC descendant sees aliens, and distributions over the number of galaxies per GC at the simulation end. The paper also considers how GC origin dates and volumes are related to each other. The paper provides two scenarios with specific numbers in Table 1. It concludes by discussing the implications for non-grabby civilizations, including their chances for soon birthing a GC, humanity's grabbiness in the next ten million years, and success in SETI.

This article discusses the ratio of NGCs (technologically advanced civilizations) to R (the number of stars in a region), and how this ratio affects SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) efforts. It is suggested that human future optimists have a low estimate of R, meaning that they believe there is a decent chance for our descendants to birth a GC. In contrast, high estimates of R are needed to expect SETI success anytime soon. The article then goes on to discuss four different spacetime regions where SETI might look, and the ratio of R required to expect one active NGC in each region. It is noted that regions further down the list are easier for us to see if they are there, but require larger ratios R for any to be there to see. It is also noted that the longevity of alien technosignatures is key to SETI success, as aliens who build beacons that function long after their civilizations die may be much easier to see. Finally, it is noted that Figures 17 and 19 are actually versions of Figures 18 and 20 in the limit of indefinite lifetime L.

The literature has modeled the evolution of life on Earth as a sequence of "hard steps", which have been compared to Earth's historical record and found to roughly fit. This model is widely accepted, but it has not been taken seriously enough. For example, the ratio of Next Generation Civilizations (NGCs) to Galactic Civilizations (GCs) has not been considered in the context of SETI optimism. This ratio, R, is important for SETI optimism because higher powers usually require lower ratios R, and thus offer more room for SETI optimism. However, a NGC to GC ratio of over one thousand is required to expect even one NGC active on our past light cone, and a ratio of over ten thousand is required to expect one anywhere in the past of our galaxy. Furthermore, a ratio of over ten million is required to expect one NGC active now in our galaxy. Today SETI struggles to see NGC techno-signatures for even a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy, making these results discouraging for SETI. The "self indication" prior for indexical probability analysis favors larger values of R in proportion to R, at least relative to the chances that one might estimate neglecting anthropic considerations. Additionally, GC-controlled volumes are mostly empty and probably transparent, and we may not yet know how to see their differences. Overall, this suggests that the standard hard-steps model should be taken more seriously when considering SETI optimism.

This paper discusses the timing of the appearance of advanced life and how it relates to the hard-steps timing power law. It presents a simple model which includes this effect, and finds that according to this model humanity today seems to be quite early, unless one assumes both a rather low planet-power and a very restrictive limit on habitable planet lifetimes. The paper also suggests that sterilizing explosions reduced galactic habitability eons ago, and some have suggested that this supports a scenario wherein advanced civilizations are far more common today than they were eons ago. However, authors have not considered applying this hard-steps-based power law to larger volumes like galaxies. The paper then introduces a model of what they call “grabby” civilizations (GC), which is a variation on models by S. Jay Olson. This model includes three parameters: expansion speed, and two parameters of the power law. It is argued that this power law is often at least a crude approximation to a more realistic model. The paper then discusses how this model can robustly explain humanity's early arrival, as it allows for a wide range of evolutionary paths and contexts.

This paper explores the power, timescale, and speed of alien expansion, which can be estimated from data to within roughly a factor of four. The hard-steps in Earth history literature is used to estimate the power, and our current date is used to estimate the power law timescale. Furthermore, the fact that we do not now see large alien-controlled volumes in our sky, even though they should control much of the universe volume now, gives us an estimate that aliens expand at over half of lightspeed. Predictions are made regarding alien timing, spacing, appearance, and the durations until we see or meet them. It is noted that optimism regarding humanity's future is in conflict with optimism regarding SETI efforts. The model used is simple and may not be an exact representation of reality; future research might explore more realistic variations. For example, one might more precisely account for the recent exponential expansion of the universe and use a more accurate appearance function instead of a power law approximation. Additionally, the GCs birth rate might vary based on local geographies of resources and obstacles. Finally, GC subvolumes might sometimes stop expanding or die due to local disturbances. The advantage of this over-simplified model is that all its parameters can be estimated using available data.
